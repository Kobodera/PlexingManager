<h1>Installation Guide</h1>
<p>This guide is designed to allow you to set the plexing manager up. It will require you to have at least some knowledge of setting up a web server. I personally use the Aprelium Abyss web server
and will add a link to it in this document. You will have to set it up yourself thought which is not that hard.</p>

<h2>Programs and links</h2>
    <p>This part contains links to the software you may need to get things running.</p>

<h3>Aprelium web server 1x</h3>
<p>Aprelium have a free personal web server capable of serving up to .Net 3.5 pages. It is reasonably easy to set up and maintain. </p>

<h3>Visual Web Developer Express</h3>
<p>Microsofts free web development environment. It is fairly limited and I am unsure if it is enough to run this project. It MAY work however so you could give it a try.</p>

<h3>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Express R2</h3>
<p>Microsofts free SQL Server. There are a couple of versions available, make sure that you get the version with tools since it will contain the Management console which will make
your life a lot easier</p>

<h2>SQL Server setup</h2>
<p>Install SQL server express on the intended server. Unless you use a domain I would suggest setting it up as Mixed Mode so that it can handle both windows authentication but also username password.</p>

<p>The default version of the plexingmanager required a user PlexManager, but if you wish to use a diffrent user that is up to you.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Database. By default this should be called PlexManager, but the name is up to you.</li>
<li>Create a new user, PlexManager and give that user read/write permissions to the PlexManager database.</li>
<li>Run the PlexManagerDB.sql script on the PlexManager database to set the tables up.</li>
<li>Run the BasicData.sql script on the PlexManager database to add basic plex data to the database.</li>
</ol>
